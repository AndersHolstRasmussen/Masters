\chapter{Analysis}
After utilizing the AUSAlib tools, the data is ready to be analyzed. Even though the theory dictates that a decay will consist of two \aps and one \bp, it is not realistic to just assume that each detected event will consist only of this configuration of particles. \\
Therefore we need some cut on what events we will allow through to the analysis. Specifically we are going to impose 3 cuts on the data, a angular cut, a momentum cut and a multiplicity cut.
