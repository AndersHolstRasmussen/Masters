\chapter{Introduction}
In this thesis i will make a thorough analysis of the the delayed \be-decay of \isotope[8]Li. The first part of the thesis will will be governing getting data from a detector sorted into an appropriate data structure that can be analyzed. 
The second part is a more physics analysis of the \al-particle pair that is produced, and their correlation to the \be-particle.
Lastly a discussion of the result and setup will be conducted.
