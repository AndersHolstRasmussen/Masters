\end{enumerate}


We want to examine the \be-delayed decay of \isotope[8]Li, which is an unstable isotope of Lithium. Lithium normally occurs stable as \isotope[6]Li and \isotope[7]Li, with the latter being the more abundant with 92.5\% of all atoms. The longest living radioactive lithium isotope is \isotope[8]Li, with a half-life of \SI{839}{ms} \note{ref}. 

\li is an interesting atom, as it will decay into \isotope[8]Be, which is a constituent in the triple-alpha process in stellar astrophysics. \isotope[8]Be creates a bottleneck for the creation of heavier elements, as it is very short lived, and have a half-life of \SI{1e-16}{s}.

\li will also decay into \ber at different energy levels, which will give a continuum of the 2+ state from \li. 

The Sub-atomic group at Aarhus University has previously measured decay of the mirror nuclei, \isotope[8]B. Since there exists very precise measurement, we want to ¨obtain similar precise measurements of \li. 

\section{Motivation}
When Henri Becquerel first discovered radioactivity in the 1890's, a new branch of atomic physics was born, namely nuclear physics. 
This new branch is the study of the atomic nuclei, their constituents and interactions. 
Over the years it has evolved quickly, first by the discovery of three different types of radiation by Curie and Rutherford, to the discovery of different nucleons, that the nucleus itself is made of. \\
\\
The technological advancements has made the study even more precise over the years, as the development of radioactive beams allow for the creation of specific short lived isotopes.
This technique is known as Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL), which was first developed in 1951 for the Copenhagen Cyclotron. 
Now the technology is available in many parts of the world, such as the IGISOL facility at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland.
Another important advancement is the development of very precise detectors, such as the Double Sided Silicon Detector (DSSD), which allows for a very high energy and spacial resolution, which can give a detailed analysis of both coincidence and kinematics. \\
\\
This brings us onto the current experiment that i have analyzed in this thesis. At the IGISOL facility, the experiment I257 was carried out in august 2020. The objective of the experiment was to measure \be-decays from \li and \isotope[12]{B}, however, this thesis will only govern the \li decay. \\
The \be-\al angular correlation is previously shown with high precision to be nearly isotropic \cite{isotrop}. The study of the \be-\al\ correlation in \li will therefore serve as a good indicator for the \be-\al\ correlation in \isotope[12]{B}, as the same setup will be used for both experiment. \\
A former student has previously made an in depth analysis of the mirror nucleus \isotope[8]{B}, which can be used to compare the excitation energy of \ber. A comparison of the two is unfortunately out of scope for this thesis.


\section{Nuclear decays}
Lithium normally occurs stable as \isotope[6]Li and \isotope[7]Li, with the latter being the more abundant with 92.5\% of all atoms. The longest living radioactive lithium isotope is \isotope[8]Li, with a half-life of \SI{839}{ms} \note{ref}. 
When \li decays, it will do so under a \be-decay, immediately followed by the \al-\al\ breakup of an intermediate exited state in \ber, which has a half life of \SI{1e-16}{s}. \ber is a constituent in the triple-alpha process in stellar astrophysics, and creates a bottleneck for the creation of heavier elements, because of its very short lifespan.

%\li will also decay into \ber at different energy levels, which will give a continuum of the 2+ state from \li. 

\subsection{\be-decay}
Most light unstable nuclei will decay by either proton/neutron emission, or by a \be-decay. Isotopes that lie close to the valley of stability will not decay by proton/neutron emission, but from a \be-decay.
\\
A \be-decay is a weak interaction, which allows a quark in a proton or neutron to change flavor, by emitting a W boson. This leads to the creation of either an electron/antineutrino pair or a positron/neutrino pair, shown as:
\begin{align}
&\beta^+:\quad p\rightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_e\\
&\beta^-:\quad n\rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu_e}.
\end{align}
Nuclei below the valley of stability will decay by $\beta^-$, while nuclei above decays by $\beta ^+$.

The energy for these decays are given by their Q-values, neglecting the very small neutrino mass and the binding energy of the electrons gives:
\begin{align}
&Q_{\beta^+} = \left[ m (\isotope[A][Z]{X}) - m(\isotope[A][Z-1]{X'})  		 \right] c^2\\
&Q_{\beta^-} = \left[ m (\isotope[A][Z]{X}) - m(\isotope[A][Z+1]{X'}) -2m_e  \right] c^2,
\end{align}
where $m$ is the mass of an atom with $Z$ protons and $A$ nucleons.
The Q-values indicates the mass difference between the initial and final product., which can be either excitation energy or kinetic energy. 

Not all \be-decays are allowed. If the spin is unchanged, it is a Fermi transition, and if it changes it is a Gamow-Teller transition. 
An allowed decay is a transition with the orbital angular moment $L = 0$, and forbidden transitions is $L > 0$.

The nuclear part of the \be-decay operator for an allowed decay is:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{O} (\beta^\pm) = g_V \sum_{A}^{j=1}\tau_\mp (j) + g_A \sum_{A}^{j=1}\sigma(j)\tau_\mp(j),
\end{equation}
where $G_V$ is weak vector coupling constant, $\tau_\mp$ is the isospin step operator, $G_A$ is the weak axial coupling constant and $\sigma$ is the Pauli spin matrices.
The first term corresponds to the Fermi operator, and the second term to the Gamow-Teller operator. 
This raises some selection rules, that dictate that for a Fermi decay, spin, isospin and parity must not be changed, and for a Gamow-Teller transitions, $\Delta J = 0, \pm1$, $\Delta T = 0, \pm 1$, and $\Delta \pi = 0$.

The selection rules then enforces that only a subset of levels are allowed to be populated in the decay of \li.
