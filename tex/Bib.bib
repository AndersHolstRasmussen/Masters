abstract = {A novel design to achieve a ultra-thin dead layer for large-area Si strip detectors is presented. The traditional contact layer making up the strip is here replaced by a grid covering only 2% of the strip area. The dead layer is thus (over 98% of the active surface) reduced to become the implantation depth only. Furthermore, the implantation depth has been reduced from 400 to 100nm.}
