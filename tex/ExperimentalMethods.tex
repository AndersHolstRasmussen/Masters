\section{Experimental Methods}
The data used in this thesis stems from an experiment carried out at the IGISOL facility, at the University of Jyväskylä. Originally the experiment was scheduled for May 2020, but was postponed due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 


\subsection{Detector setup}
The detection setup consists of 6 double sided silicon detectors (DSSD), and 6 single sided silicon detectors (SSD). 
The detectors are $\SI{5}{cm} \times \SI{5}{cm}$ and placed in a cube around the a target in the center, as shown on figure \ref{fig}. The setup is designed with measuring the opening angle of the $\beta$ in mind, and therefore the detectors covers 51\% of the solid angle. \\
