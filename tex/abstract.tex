\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis gives a detailed analysis of the \be-delayed \al-decay of \li. The analysis is based on data from experiment I257, which was conducted at the IGISOL facility at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland in august 2020. 

The goal of the analysis is to validate and test the experimental setup. The setup is also used to study the \be-decay of \isotope[12]{B}, where 3 \al-particles will be emitted in less than 1\% of the decays.
Therefore the setup must be able to measure \al-particles with high efficiency in an environment with a lot of \be-particles. 

The excitation spectra of \ber compares well to previous studies, and the efficiency of detecting \al-particles is very high.
The setup is able to measure the \be-\al\ angular correlation, which should be isotropic. However some obstacles make it hard to conclude that the correlation is perfectly isotropic, and a discussion of the geometric effects that might cause this is included.
